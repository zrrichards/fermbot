##Structure
The Fermbot is broken down into two modules:
1. The monitor collects fermentation statistics and uploads them to brewfather. It takes a snapshot of the fermentation
   every 15 minutes.
2. The controller is responsible for activating the heating and cooling relays to control fermentation
